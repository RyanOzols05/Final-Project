# Final-Project
# Title: D&D Character Generator
# Purpose: The purpose of this code is to create a character generator for hit TTRPG(tabletop roleplaying game) Dungeons and Dragons, commonly abbreviated to D&D.
# Goals: By the end of June, I want to have made a fully, or at least mostly, functional character generator for D&D.  The reasoning behind the "mostly" is that I am unsure if I will be able to properly integrate spell lists into the project, as well as a few other smaller things like languages and backgrounds, though the goal is to include them all if possible.
# Technology Used: Python for all the coding required, and something to either create an actual display or convert the output into a PDF format, I'm not 100% sure which route I'm going to follow yet.
